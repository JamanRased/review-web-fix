            <p className='p-4 m-3'>Digital transformation is on the rise and affecting every industry imaginable. Farmers are no longer merely sowing seeds and harvesting a crop; theyâ€™re using sensors and information technology to automate, monitor, and regulate their systems to become more profitable, efficient, and sustainable. Food delivery apps are helping restaurants provide their menu options to hungry patrons without them having to leave their homes. This adds a complex layer of responsibilities for restaurant workers who now must manage orders through digital devices, as well as any in-person interactions. Even real estate, a traditionally face-to-face industry, relies on digital skills. Virtual walk-throughs are available to prospects looking to relocate, and signing documents remotely with services like DocuSign is a quick and convenient way to finalize an agreement.</p>
